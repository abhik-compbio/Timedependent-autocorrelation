# Timedependent-autocorrelation
This code can be used to calculate time dependent autocorrelation function for protein dihedral angles.
We need 2 input file two run the code.
* "dyncorr_respair.dat" - this file contain the name of two output file and residue number of which we need to calculate timedependent auto correlation functions.
* "input-dataset.dat"- dihedral angle value of each dihedral angle obtained from molecular dynamics simulations.
